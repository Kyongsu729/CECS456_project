# CECS456_project

This is the project in CECS456, Machine learning class. The split_dataset.py is for splitting the images into train, validation and test sets, so this file is no longer used. In cnn.ipynb, there is the code used on only Google colab. When using this file and training the models, using Google colab is recommended because it took a long time to train without A100 GPU.
